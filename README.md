## My process

My process was not as structured as I had hoped it would be. I worked on several components at the same time and this resulted in my having to go back to fix components.

Also I didn't use any css library and this was a major drawback on my progress as I had to battle with overlapping
styles for components

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- React
- JavaScript
- React modal library

### What I learned

I learnt quite a lot on the project. This is my first completed react project and I learnt a vast amount which I cannot list
everything here. I will try my best though.

- How to add a google font to a react app
  [https://blog.greenroots.info/3-quick-ways-to-add-fonts-to-your-react-app]
  I used the first style of adding the link tags to the head of the index.html, then
  I added a css rule to the app.css file.

- Learnt how to import images in react covered in the link
  [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/]

- Learnt how to stop child flex items from being full width
  [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41694559/stop-flex-child-from-being-full-width]

-Learnt how to import svgs in react
[https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/]

- Learnt how to use react router
  [https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/tutorial]
  STEPS

1. import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom': This is done in your index.js
   The BrowserRouter component is then used to wrap the app component like below:
   <BrowserRouter>
   <App />
   </BrowserRouter>

2. We import Link to our App component.
   import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
   This will give control of the URL to react router.Anytime a link is clicked the url
   will change to whatever string you added to the "to" attribute in the link tag.

I learnt to use

- styled components: a react library to help in organising and keeping my css contained.
- Working on a part of the project and completing it before going to another part of the project.
- Static images are stored in the public folder in react projects.
  -How to use the useState Hook. This was my first time using Hooks and I saw how important they can be.
  -How to pass methods and state between components. Here I put shared methods and passed them into the components in the
  app.js. I have never done this before and this helped me understand react's uni-directional flow whereby state flows from the
  parent to the child component.
- react modal library. This awesome resource made it very easy for me to create and use a modal in my react application.
  Highly recommended.

### Continued development

I intend to continue my development on CSS Grid, BEM and SASS because I wish to use these methodolgies for all my future projects.
I also intend to work on more react project using Hooks and Redux if possible to improve my understanding of data flow in
a react application.
I will also use styled components and some other UI librarys to help keep my CSS organised.
